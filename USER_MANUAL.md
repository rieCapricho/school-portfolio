INTRODUCTION: Grace Records: Canonical Record Sorter, developed by Team CTRL, is an innovative digital database system designed to revolutionize the management of baptismal and confirmation records in parish offices across the Archdiocese of Davao. This project addresses inefficiencies in handling physical records, such as delays and misplacement, by transitioning to a centralized digital platform that enhances data retrieval, reduces administrative burdens, and improves security. With user-friendly features like robust search capabilities, record addition, viewing, editing, and deletion, Grace Records streamlines document management, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and confidentiality.
